\fBfor i in \./*\.pdf ; do {pdftk "$i" dump_data | grep \-i numberofpages} ; done\fP
Do something for each (non hidden) file in the current directory\. Extremely useful for commands that do not support more than one file as an argument (such as pdftk in this example)\. This specific example will print the number of pages for each pdf in the current directory, modify it to your liking
